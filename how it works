how pygame work in the conceptual level 
    -every pygame consiste of 2 parts
    -part 1, where you set up all the code you need for the game that is game logic
    -part 2, is the loop for runing the game. inside the loop pygame continuously cycle 
through a while loop updates the code and raw the resulting pictures and since that happens
many times pers second we perciev this as a moving image

setup part
-----------
1) create a rectangule
2) set the starting posion and movent speed

loop
-----------
1) function to make the rectangule move to the right by the movenment speend once per loop cycle

-------------------------------------------set by step -------------------------------
    1 create setup module
    2 Drawing on our window
            befor drawing you need to understand the highranking of 4 diffrent concept
            --display surface. this is what we drawn and we can only have one.
                --regular sueface. a lay that hold materials in order to keep your game organise. this
                  unlike most be need in the display surface. NB we can have many regular surfaces
                --rectangular surface. it is use to encapsulate shapes and regular surfaces
                    which make them more easier to manipulate and measure them
